## Installation

You can install the library using npm:

```shell
npm i create-word-puzzle
```

## Usage

1. Import the package into your project:

```js
import createWordPuzzle from 'create-word-puzzle';
```

- in Node.js:

```js
const createWordPuzzle = require('create-word-puzzle');
```

2. Generate a word puzzle by providing a list of words and defining the grid width and height as an object. This function accepts an options object as an argument and returns an object as a result:

```js
const words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
const puzzle = createWordPuzzle({ wordlist: words, width: 8, height: 8 });
```

You can access the output grid array from the grid property of puzzle object.

Example grid array output:

```js
[
  ['X', 'B', 'A', 'N', 'A', 'N', 'A', 'A'],
  ['Q', 'W', 'J', 'H', 'M', 'Q', 'X', 'P'],
  ['L', 'W', 'O', 'C', 'S', 'Y', 'W', 'P'],
  ['D', 'Q', 'A', 'H', 'N', 'B', 'U', 'L'],
  ['P', 'U', 'A', 'E', 'U', 'G', 'Y', 'E'],
  ['Y', 'R', 'J', 'R', 'Y', 'I', 'C', 'J'],
  ['L', 'F', 'S', 'R', 'V', 'D', 'Y', 'U'],
  ['L', 'L', 'K', 'Y', 'V', 'Q', 'R', 'N'],
];
```

3. You can customize the puzzle generation by providing additional options:

```js
const puzzle = createWordPuzzle({
  wordlist: words,
  width: 8,
  height: 8,
  minWordLength: 4,
  listSize: 8,
  margin: 0,
  shareLetters: true,
  allowReverseWords: true,
  reverseWordRatio: 0.33,
});
```

## Options

Here are all the options you can provide to customize the puzzle:

| listSize          | number  | undefined | The listSize parameter specifies the number of words to be included in the puzzle. In some cases, the algorithm may not be able to fit all the provided words due to constraints such as grid dimensions and word lengths. |
